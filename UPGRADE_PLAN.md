# Website Upgrade Plan

This document tracks the planned upgrades for the website. We'll check off items as they're completed.

## Current Focus: Complete TypeScript Migration

We are fully committing to TypeScript for this project. The approach is:

1. Convert JavaScript components to TypeScript (.tsx)
2. Delete original JavaScript files once TypeScript versions are properly tested
3. Update imports across the application to use TypeScript components
4. Ensure proper type definitions for all props and state

## 1. Code Organization & Structure

- [x] Implement standardized folder structure for components
- [ ] Standardize component file naming to PascalCase
- [x] Break large components into smaller ones
- [x] Add index files for cleaner imports
- [x] Remove original JavaScript files after successful TypeScript migration - Started with dashboard.js, Hero.js, Experience.js, Skills.js, Education.js

## 2. TypeScript Migration

- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Convert core files (App, index)
- [x] Create type definitions for props
- [x] Convert components incrementally - Completed Layout, Header, Dashboard, Hero, Experience, Skills, Education

## 3. React Architecture Updates

- [x] Update React Router configuration
- [x] Extract complex logic to custom hooks
- [ ] Improve Context API usage for shared state
- [x] Add error handling with ErrorBoundary

## 4. Performance Optimization

- [x] Implement code splitting by routes
- [ ] Add React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Optimize images
- [x] Add lazy loading for non-critical components

## 5. Testing Coverage

- [ ] Set up testing framework enhancements
- [ ] Add unit tests for key components
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add accessibility tests

## 6. Accessibility Improvements

- [ ] Review and update semantic HTML
- [ ] Add necessary ARIA attributes
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Verify color contrast compliance

## 7. Build & Deployment

- [ ] Add bundle analyzer
- [ ] Enhance CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Fix GitHub Pages basename configuration

## 8. Code Quality & Standards

- [x] Clean up unused imports and code
- [ ] Update ESLint configuration
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Standardize Tailwind usage

## 9. API & Data Handling

- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add consistent loading states
- [ ] Convert API services to TypeScript

## 10. Modern React Features

- [ ] Evaluate server components usage
- [x] Implement Suspense for data fetching
- [ ] Update to latest hooks patterns

## Next Steps

1. Continue converting remaining components to TypeScript:

   - Certifications.tsx
   - Others in priority order

2. Update App.tsx to import directly from TypeScript components instead of through lazy loading

3. Implement React.memo for expensive components like Skills that use complex animations

4. Update ESLint configuration for better TypeScript support

5. Add JSDoc documentation to exported functions and components

6. Review and update semantic HTML for accessibility improvements
